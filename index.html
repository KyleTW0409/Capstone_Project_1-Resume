        <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>
            It's funny I don't really know what to say here. I know that you're supposed to 
            sort of buttress yourself to make you look like the perfect person to hire but 
            that feels very superficial so I'm not going to do that. Instead I'm going to be
            perfectly honest to you (yes I realise that, most likely, no one will ever see this resume)
            and to myself. Truth is I have know idea what I'm capable of, I know I have potential
            and so my current goal right now is to figure out just how much I am capable of. And so
            hopefully oneday when I do write one of these for an actual job I won't need to buttress
            I will simply be able to tell the truth as I've done here. But for now I will keep
            learning.
